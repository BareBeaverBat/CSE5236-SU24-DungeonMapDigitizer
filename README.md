## About

This was a group project for 2024 Summer session of CSE5236 (Mobile App Development).  
The goal for the app is to create an android app that 
* takes a picture of a hand-drawn dungeon map
* uses an LMM (aka LVLM) to do a preliminary digitization of it to a graph (nodes are rooms and edges are hallways) 
* offers the user a UI for editing/fixing the graph digitization
