# CSE5236-SU24-DungeonMapDigitizer
group project for 2024 Summer session of CSE5236 (Mobile App Development); The goal for the app is to create an android app that takes a picture of a hand-drawn dungeon map, uses an LMM to do a preliminary digitization of it to a graph (nodes are rooms and edges are hallways), and then offers the user a UI for editing/fixing the graph digitization
